* The Sugestio library has a Settings.php. You do not have to edit this file, 
everything can be configured through the Drupal's administration system.

* Go to Administer > Site building > Modules and enable the Sugestio module

* Run Drupal's update.php

* Go to Administer > Site configuration > Sugestio settings and make any changes

* By default, the Sugestio module is configured to use the Sandbox account credentials 
and will work out of the box. If you use the fivestar voting system on your website, 
votes will now be automatically submitted to the Sugestio service, 
where they will be discarded. See README.md for more information about the Sandbox.

work with real data.
